# 👋 Hi, I'm Adeniyi Abdul-Raheem ADEYEMI

I’m an aspiring backend engineer with a healthcare background, focused on building scalable, API-driven products that solve real-world problems.

I’ve built and contributed to multiple backend systems, including WellaPath (health access platform), UrbanSphere (smart-city planning tools), and TaskPilot AI (automation platform). I design and implement RESTful APIs, authentication flows, and data models using Python, FastAPI, and SQL, with a strong focus on clean architecture, validation, and scalability.


I collaborate with other engineers through Fortune Techies, gaining hands-on experience with team workflows, version control, and production-minded development.

Top Technical Skills

Python • FastAPI • RESTful API Design

SQL • Data Modeling • JWT/OAuth Authentication

Backend Architecture • Git/GitHub • API Documentation

I’m currently open to remote backend internships and project-based roles, where I can contribute immediately and grow as an engineer.


Tools & Technologies:

- Bash | Git & GitHub | REST APIs | JSON

- Microsoft Excel, Word | Google Sheets & Docs
